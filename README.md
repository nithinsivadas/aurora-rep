Research with Josh Semeter

This repository contains matlab codes written from Summer 2015 for grabbing data from THEMIS satellites and PFISR ground radar system. PFISR data is accessed through madrigal database and THEMIS through the Space Physics Data centre. All the codes are currently written in MATLAB. The data analysis is specifically aimed at the high energy (>100 keV) precipitation of electron observed during substorm events in the higher latitudes (>50 degrees).

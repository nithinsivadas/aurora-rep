Verification of high energy electron precipitation models using conjugate ground and space-based measurements

Poker-Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar has observed electron density enhancement at substantially low altitudes during auroral substorms. This suggest precipitation of high energy electrons of energies ~ 300 keV. The primary electron spectra can be derived from the incoherent scatter radar measurements using the method described in Semeter and Kamalabadi (2005). The derived primary electron spectra hinges on the model of the neutral atmosphere, and the interaction of primary electrons with it. Comparing this energy spectra with conjugate measurements made using the THEMIS spacecraft above the neutral atmosphere, will prove to be an independent verification of the accuracy of the results predicted by these models. Furthermore, we will investigate how the time variations in the precipitation affect the compressed pulse (in this case, the Barker Code).
